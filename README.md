# gpt-chat-autoresponder
Due to the fact that VK has blocked access to the "sendMessage" API, messsages are will be sent by emulating actions in the browser via selenium. 
## So,for this tool works fine,you need to download browser driver like "chomedriver".
## Also,for usage you need to:
+ find your VK token,wich provides an access to the API's and gptChat key.
+ Set up all id's for responding in file called "id.txt"
On the first launch, you will be asked to fill in all the required data.After that,they will be contained in "data.json" file
